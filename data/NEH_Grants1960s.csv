Three-part program: 1) A Better Chance (ABC) program, takes 9th and 10th grade students from limited education backgrounds and, after a summer of intensive study, places them in preparatory and secondary schools from which they have a better chance to proceed to college. 2) Smith-Amherst Tutorial Program (SATP), helps high school students overcome educational deficiencies through tutorial work in 2 consecutive summers. 3) English Teacher's Institute (ETI) for secondary school teachers from the Springfield, Massachusetts, school system, emphasizing English as an activity every individual engages in whenever he speaks, reads, or writes.  The ETI and SATP programs are coordinated to provide interaction between teachers and students during the course of the summer.  Program created as a result of the Black-White Action Committee formed after Martin Luther King's assassination to outline reforms designed to improve racial relations.

ABSTRACT: Development of curriculum materials in the social sciences for Mexican-American students, with dissemination of results in five Southwestern states.  Concentration on several areas: 1) 16 curriculum units with teachers' manuals, high school and junior high level, centering on prominent figure in Mexican history and designed to encourage sense of cultural identity; 2) 6 children's books at the elementary level (grade 4); 3) film-strip focusing on aspects of Mexican history.  Additional units developed under NEH grant EO-253-70-4650.   Traditional curricula tend to ignore the Mexican culture and present the Mexican-American child with Dick-and-Jane type, ""Anglo"" curriculum materials.  Child is unable to identify with visual  materials presented and is often hampered in learning to read because the content of the primary books not only reflects middle class values different from the child's own but also ignores his  individual heritage.  To reverse the high drop-out rate and low literacy level among Mexican Americans it is necessary to present materials which recognize their values and the worth of their  culture.

ABSTRACT:  Eastern High School Freedom Annex, established by a group of students at that school, offers a curriculum to run concurrently with the D.C. school year and is available for full elective credit in lieu of elective courses from the regular curriculum at Eastern High. Two 3-hour sessions each day--to keep classes small--consist of a one-hour class, a one-hour small group discussion, and a one-hour creative workshop.  Black History, Black Literature, Black Philosophy, Community Organization, Third World Studies, Contemporary Problem, Economics, Black Art and Drama, Black Music and Swahili offered.  A competent teaching staff has been found.  Space is provided without charge by a neighboring Lutheran church.  NEH staff visitors have found that the school appears to be functioning well.  Many poor students, including previous drop-outs, are being stimulated into genuine study by program.  Fine and rapidly growning library.

ABSTRACT: Series of presentations, based on general theme, ""Time Out for Man,"" conducted by scholars and performers from disciplines within the humanities and social sciences for non-academic audiences in 43 culturally remote U.S. communities.  Six humanities teams (one professor and 2 or 3 performers) employed variety of media and methods to extend and communicate their knowledge to the public; to stimulate public interest in educational opportunity and to demonstrate the need for the humanist in complex and technological world.  Each community received three, two-day visits, a different team for each visit.  Topics for three performances were, ""The Private Sphere,"" man's personal relationships; ""The Human Community,"" man and society, cooperation and conflict; and ""The Good Life,"" man and environment, response to technology and nature.  Performances given for general audiences, service, civic, church and social organizations, as well as some high school and community college groups, reaching over 126,000 people in 21 states, from February to May 1970.  Evaluation by audiences, participants, NEH staff members indicates that programs were educationally solid.  Significant in improving public adult education, improving local leadership, bringing humanities to large groups of people and breaking down barrier between community and academia.

ABSTRACT: Training program in archeology June 16-August 8, 1969.  College anthropology majors with previous archeological experience train and supervise high school students in the excavation of an Indian village (c. 1450-1550 A.D.), located in Washington Boro, Pennsylvania.  Project introduces high school students to archeological study and techniques while providing teaching experience for college students.  Provided valuable experience in dealing with preliterate culture.  From an archeological standpoint the unearthing of a major portion of a large Indian village was a major accompliment, since it revealed that the Shenk's Ferry Indians (an aboriginal tribe that inhabited the lower Susquehanna Valley in the 15th century), previously considered a wandering tribe which built campsites rather than fixed villages, built at least one village housing nearly 1000 Indians.

Phase II:  collection, supported by sociological information, will be basis of two types of interpretive exhibits directed toward 1) urban populations, predominantly new Alaskans and unaware of the social and economic situation outside of the urban area; and 2) the rural, isolated population, predominantly native, which needs insight and understanding of its own adaptation through time to help it survive in a changing society.

ABSTRACT:  Project purposes to re-create the community of Annapolis, Maryland as it existed from 1782-86 in a book or series of articles which will enhance historical understanding of this important 18th century urban cultural and political center and, therefore, illuminate a significant segment of national heritage.  During the period under study, Annapolis played important role in nurturing the nation's new government, serving for a time as the U.S. capital, as the site of the Confederation Congress and of the Annapolis convention (which resulted in the Constitutional Convention).  Will question how revolutionary Annopolis was structured economically, socially and politically and how it functioned.  Emphasis on physical similarities of present city to past community in effort to relate community to its environment.  Annapolis particularly suited to project because of its well-preserved state and the availability of records and documents regarding the city and its historic development.  Other purposes of the project are to improve present community spirit and involvment and to development knowledge that will serve as incentive for an historical restoration and interpretation program.

Center editions&nbsp;will exclude errors compiled through frequent reprintings but will&nbsp;include changes made by the author himself in later editions. The Center&nbsp;will control disbursement of funds so editors' salaries and collating cost result in finished manuscripts according to schedule, and will insure replacment of editor and continuation of work should the original editor be unable to complete their work. The Center provides a uniform editorial manual, the&nbsp;Guide to Editorial Principles, which serves both as a research tool for the project and as a reference work for other scholars. Paperback editions&nbsp;will be produced from many of the same plates, encouraging dissemination of accurate texts to students and the&nbsp;public at low cost.

ABSTRACT:  Funds to support writing of book, research for which is nearly complete, to develop a definition of the concept of ""party"" and partisanship by examining both conemporary and classical (i.e. Plato, Aristotle, Machiavelli, Burke, Toqueville and the authors of The Federalist) views of party.  Political parties have been praised for ameliorating conflict by the accommodation of diverse groups and interests to maintain a consensus, and damned for being anti-democratic institutions that thwart popular majorities and threaten consensus by their repeated failure to confront serious public problems and to develop policy capable of resolving them.  These conflicting views demonstrate inadequcy of present theoretical concepts of party.  Adequate theoretical definition will help correct popular misconceptions of party which are, in part, the cause of disillusionment in minority groups and in the young.",What is Party?

ABSTRACT: Funds for cataloguing extensive collection of microfilm manuscripts.  Microfilm Library established at St. John's in 1964 in order to preserve all medieval manuscripts still extant in European monastic and allied libraries and of making these available to American scholars and students in a single center in the US.  To date, approximately 9 million pages filmed and deposited at Library including writings on subjects from grammar and dialectic to law, medicine, philosophy, history, agriculture, history of science, etc.  Adequate cataloguing is necessary for proper utilization of the collection.  Many manuscript collections in Europe, often in monasteries which are isolated geographically, difficult of access and badly catalogued.  For practical purposes they are as unavailable to European researchers as to American.  By filming, centralizing and cataloging these manuscripts, St. John's will make a large and basic contribution to humanistic knowledge.",Monastic Manuscript Microfilm Library,0,{},1969

ABSTRACT: Funds for the first and basic conference of distinguished linguistic scholars working toward the implementation of a program to describe the languages of the world.  At this conference 14 state-of-the-art papers (e.g., ""Descriptive Adequacies in Linguistic,"" ""Problems of Lexicon,"" ""Language Standardization,"" ""Universals in Language"") will be presented by participants from the US. A few foreign observers will be invited to secure international cooperation.  The conference will set guidelines to make future investigations more effective and increase cooperation among linguistic scholars in the contemporary undertaking.  The only scholarly survey of the description of languages of the works is now very much outmoded due to advances in linguistic techniques since it was compiled.  The project will describe languages in a more systematic way, using modern techniques.  Project is timely because of the availability of technological aids as well as a large number of professional linguists in the world to complete the task.  Conference should lead ultimately to the compilation of a handbook of background information about languages, such as language map-making, socio-linguistic information, their legal status and their varying designations; and a definition of the basic requirements for a description of the languages of the world. It will enable us to understand our own and other languages better.",Conference on Languages of the World,0,{},1969
